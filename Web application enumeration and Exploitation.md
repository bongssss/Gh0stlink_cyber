- web apps exist everywhere and have become part of our daily lives.
- a single vulnerability can compromise a lot of user data that impacts reputation of the organisation that owns the web app.
-  web app security involves identifying mitigating and preventing these vulnerabilities from being exploited
- **OWASP** Open Worldwide Application Security Project. responsible to enumerating web application vulnerabilities and making them public knowledge.
### Burp Suite 
- A tool that is used to intercept, edit and change the properties of a web(http/https) traffic packet
- used by pen testers and security  professionals 
- developed by PortSwigger 
- listend on localhost port 8080 and localhost ip 127.0.0.1
#### Core features
 
- **PROXY**: intercepts https traffic between web server and web app on browser (*forward and backward proxies*) proxy contain s intercept and forward options. Forward allows the traffic to be sent to its pre-determined server location presumably after being modified.

- **REPEATER** allows manual editing and resending of requests after modification (which happens after proxy has intercepted traffic/http(s) request)

- **INTRUDER** performs automated fuzzing and brute-force attacks (testing random values to see how a web application responds). It injects payloads into different http(s) requests to test for vulnerabilities.
to use intruder; you send an intercepted request from *proxy* to *intruder*. 
Then you choose payload positions by highlighting parts of the request selected for intended attack i.e., user credentials in a login request. Then you select an attack type
###### Types of Attacks (Intruder)
- Battering ram
- Pitch fork (Password/credential stuffing)
- cluster bomb (Brute-force)
- sniper (Password/credential spraying)
After choosing an attack type, you configure a payload i.e., in the case of a login request by either listing the values you would like to try or adding them to a file and uploading. After this, the intruder sends the attack to the server with the payload as part of the network traffic. 

###### Core Features continued
- **SCANER** (Pro only feature) allows for automatic vulnerability discovery and report generation

- **DECODER** encoding or decoding or translating data from one format to another 
**How it works:**
 You paste or type data into the input box.
 You choose an operation from the list (e.g., URL decode, Base64 decode, HTML encode).
Burp instantly converts the data and shows you the result in the output box.
You can apply multiple operations in a chain (e.g., URL decode _then_ Base64 decode _then_ convert from hex).

- **COMPARER** highlights differences in http(s) request values



### How to use Burp suite
- Set up and manage proxies on burp site using proxy management tools. This is the only way to actually route the traffic from your browser to burp suite.
- You can also setup proxy manually on your browser suing the localhost ip address 127.0.0.1 and port 8080
- on burp suite, turn on intercept to capture the request on burp suite



## Configuring Burp Suite
- install a proxy configuration tool (makes it easier to specify proxy rules) foxy proxy or similar 


### Burp Suite Demo 
https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/
the things I was able to do
- Downloading and installing Burp Suite. easiest as it came pre installed on kali linux
- Intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy using the intercept feature of Proxy
- Modifying requests in Burp Proxy modifying requests before forwarding them to monitor behaviour
- Setting the target scope using target
- Manually reissuing requests with Burp Repeater:
This lets you study the target website's response to different input without having to intercept the request each time. This makes it much simpler to probe for vulnerabilities, or confirm ones that were identified by Burp Scanner
- Running your first scan. (pro feature)
- Generating a report. (pro feature)
