A way of communicating with devices on the internet without having to remember/memorise numbers like IP and MAC addresses.

### Domain Hierarchy

- TLD (Top Level Domains): the rightmost part of a domain name, they come in two types 

Example 1 : A gTLD (such as .com / .org) generic Top level domain would be for a specific purpose (such as commercial or an organisation). Due to demand, new gTLDs are being used (e.g. .online / .club)

Example 2: A ccTLD country code top level domain would be for country codes (such as .ng / .co.uk).

A Second-Level Domain is restricted to 63 characters and is located to the right of s top level domain, can only use (a-z, 0-9) and hyphens. The maximum length of a domain name is 253 characters.
