The process of creating virtual versions of a computer resource(s) such as Operating systems,  servers or networks, giving us the ability to run multiple virtual environments/machines on a single physical piece of hardware. 
This is done for several purposes the most common of which (in the case of penetration testing) is the need to replicate the digital infrastructure of an organisation within a controlled environment. 
Another other reason for virtualisation includes efficiency of managing resources i.e., storage 

There are several different types of virtualisation, typically depending on the type of resource that is being virtualised.

they include 
- **Server virtualisation**: This is where a single physical server (or host) is configured such that it can house multiple virtual servers. This type of virtualisation is fairly common and can be achieved using a hypervisor, a type of software (most common), hardware or  firmware that can run different operating systems simultaneously on an individual host/server. The hypervisor does this by creating and managing different virtual machines, each running its own different Operating System.
- **Desktop virtualisation**: Is very similar to server virtualisation, the difference being that while server virtualisation aims to maximise the efficiency of a physical server by running different Operating Systems, desktop virtualisation utilise the resources of a single physical host/server for running a single virtual Operating System.
- **Network virtualisation**: this is where the functions or services associated with physical networks are abstracted from hardware such as switches and routers and presented as software based instead. This has the effect of creating efficiency through network resource optimisation which leads to improvements in scalability.
- **Storage virtualisation** : This form of virtualisation combines multiple storage devices into a single virtual storage facility.
- **App virtualisation** : This runs applications in isolated/controlled environments, without installing them on the host/server Operating system
